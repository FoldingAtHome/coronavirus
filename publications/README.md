Enclosed is essentially an extended annotated bibliography. Each article read on SARS or SARS-2 will have it's own folder that will include:
1. a PDF copy of the article
2. a `README.md` that includes
   * The proper citation of the article (DOI)
   * a BRIEF summary of the article
   * all additional notes taken from the article

Please follow the `README_template.md` structure for each article added.
