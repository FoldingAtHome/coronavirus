# **Additional Notes**
**Coronaviruses: Overview**
-   Large, enveloped, (+) strand RNA virus
-   Large Spike Protein on virion surface → mediates cell attachment/membrane fusion
    -   Cleaved by furin/another type protein to create **2 subunits:**
        -   S1: receptor attachment site; 666 aa residues
            -   Residues 318-510 can form tight binding to the peptidase domain of ACE2 → Considered the "RBD" (Receptor-Binding Domain)
                -   Includes important **viral-neutralizing epitopes (21-23) **
                    -   may be sufficient to raise a protective Ab response
        -   S2: fusion activity; 583 aa residue
            -   Refolded heptad-repeat fragments from Mouse SARS(MHV)/SARS-CoV6-8 confirm that post fusion conformation has a trimer of hairpins organization characteristic of **class 1 fusion proteins**
                -   I.e. HIV, influenza, ebola
                -   fusion peptide (FP) and the two heptad repeat regions (HR-N and HR-C) 
        -   Mature SARS-CoV do not have cleaved spike proteins (no subunits)
            -   MHV shows cleavage site no longer has essential residues for furin susceptibility
-   Utilize cell-surface zinc peptidase, angiotensin-convertiy enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor
    -   ACE2 ectodomain → claw-like N-terminal peptidase domain, Active site at the base of a deep groove, C-terminal "collectrin" domain
**S1 Region Residues 318 to 510: Receptor Binding Domain**
-   All that is needed for tight binding to ACE2 peptidase domain
    -   critical for virus-receptor interaction
-   Changes in few aa residues can lead to cross-species **transimssion**
-   **include viral-neutralizing epitopes** (may be able to create Ab)
-   Contains 2 subdomains: **Core and extended Loop**
    -   Core
        -   5 anti-parallel Beta Sheets with 3 short connecting alpha helices
            -   B1 to B4 and B7; aA to aC
        -   9 cysteins in chmotryptic fragment
            -   disulfide bonds connect cysteines 323 to 348, 366 to 419 and 467 to 474
                -   remaining 2 (378 and 511) could form a disulfide in the recombinant fragment if they have other partners in the intact S protein
    -   Extended Loop
        -   presents a gently concave outer surface formed by 2 beta sheets (B5 and B6)
        -   Base is concave and cradles the N-terminal helix of ACE2
            -   Has a ridge on side that is reinforced by Cys467--Cys474 disulfide bridge → contacts between ACE2 helices a2 and a3
            -   other side ridge inserts between a short ACE2 residues 329 to 333 helix and a beta hairpin at ACE2 353 residue
    -   Residues 445 to 460 of RBD ANCHOR the entire receptor binding loop to the core of the RBD
    -   **Receptor Binding Motif (RBM):** residues 424 to 494 → loop of residues that make all contacts with ACE2
        -   complementary to the receptor tip (total of 18 residues of the receptor contact 14 residues of the viral spike protein)

**Experimental RBD Protein : ACE2 Complex Generation**
-   Expressed SARS-CoV Spike protein RBD (residues 306 to 575) in Sf9 cells
    -   Purified fragment → treat with chymotrypsin → final fragment residues 306-527
-   Expressed soluble ACE2 residues 19-615 in Sf9 cells
    -   Purified fragment → treat with chymotrypsin
-   Combined products and complex was purified by size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200
    -   2 asymmetric units were then grown
