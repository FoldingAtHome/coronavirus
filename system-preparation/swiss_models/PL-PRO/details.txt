Papain-like proteinase (PL-PRO):
Responsible for the cleavages located at the N-terminus of the replicase polyprotein. In addition, PL-PRO possesses a deubiquitinating/deISGylating activity and processes both 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains from cellular substrates. Participates together with nsp4 in the assembly of virally induced cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicles necessary for viral replication. Antagonizes innate immune induction of type I interferon by blocking the phosphorylation, dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation of host IRF3. Prevents also host NF-kappa-B signaling.

One domain is covered by an experimental structure (PDB 6vxs) and several other domains are covered by high quality models
