Host translation Inhibitor nsp1 (nsp1):
Inhibits host translation by interacting with the 40S ribosomal subunit. The nsp1-40S ribosome complex further induces an endonucleolytic cleavage near the 5'UTR of host mRNAs, targeting them for degradation. Viral mRNAs are not susceptible to nsp1-mediated endonucleolytic RNA cleavage thanks to the presence of a 5'-end leader sequence and are therefore protected from degradation. By suppressing host gene expression, nsp1 facilitates efficient viral gene expression in infected cells and evasion from host immune response.

Model quality estimates are low - use with care.
